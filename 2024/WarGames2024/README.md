#### Challenge Files: [Leak_stuff.rar](../WarGames2024/Files/Leak_stuff.rar)

### Solution

This challenge was straightforward, and here's how I solved it step-by-step:

1. **Decompressing the Archive:**
   First, I extracted the contents of the [Leak_stuff.rar](../WarGames2024/Files/Leak_stuff.rar) file. Inside the archive, I found two files: `user.txt` and `password.txt`.

2. **Identifying the User:**
   The challenge prompt asked to search for the user "osman" in the `user.txt` file. I quickly found the user at line 337.

3. **Finding the Encrypted Password:**
   I looked for the corresponding line in the `password.txt` file. The entry related to "osman" turned out to be: `ZJPB{e6g180g9f302g8d8gddg1i2174d0e212}`

4. **Decrypting the Password:**
   The string looked like a Caesar cipher with a shift. I tried various Caesar cipher shifts using the online tool [Cryptii](https://cryptii.com/). The shift of **23** decrypted the string correctly.

#### Challenge Files: [gift.gif.zip](../WarGames2024/Files/gift.gif.zip)

### Solution

This challenge involved extracting the Flag from  a GIF file. Hereâ€™s how I solved it:
   I opened the [gif.gif](../WarGames2024/Files/ gift.gif.zip) file using a normal image preview software, that allowed me to view the individual frames of the GIF as static images (ause i opened it as an image).
   The GIF had **1402 frames** in total. I scrolled through all the frames and found the flag in the **last frame**.

3. **Alternative Approach (Using Online Tools):**
   You can use online tools like [ezgif](https://ezgif.com/split) to split the GIF into all its frames, if you can't run the gif as image. From there, you can easily locate and copy the flag from the final frame.

### Solution

 **Initial Analysis:**
   -Given a GIF file that presumably contains hidden information
   -"Invisible ink" Title suggests that some parts of the image might be hidden or partially visible
 **Steganography analysis tool:**
    -Analyzing the GIF file using *StegSolve* to extract individual frames, found 2 distinct frames:

 **Flag Recovery:**

 -The flag was split across two frames. Using Stegsolve's frame combiner we merge the two frames, revealing the complete flag.
